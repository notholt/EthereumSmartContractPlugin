# EthereumSmartContractPlugin

This project uses the library web3j. Further insturctions on installation (MAVEN) look at:

https://docs.web3j.io/getting_started.html

This program opens a UDP channel where data can be received. The web3j library calls the respective smart contract.

Please note that the smart contract must be wrapped before it can be calledby the java class. For this you need both bin and abi files, as well as web3j command line tool.

To generate the abi and bin you may use remix
